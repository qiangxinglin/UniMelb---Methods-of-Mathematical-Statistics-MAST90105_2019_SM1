# Overview
This subject introduces probability and the theory underlying modern statistical inference. Properties of probability are reviewed, univariate and multivariate random variables are introduced, and their properties are developed.

# Intended Learning Outcomes
* Develop a systematic understanding of probability, random variables, probability distributions and probability models, and their relevance to statistical inference;
* Be able to formulate standard probability models from real world applications and critically assess them;
* Be able to apply the properties of probability distributions, moment generating functions, variable transformations and conditional expectations to analyse common random variables and probability models;
* Be able to use a computer package to perform algebraic and computational tasks in probability analyses.
* Be familiar with the basic ideas of estimation and hypothesis testing
* Be able to carry out many standard statistical procedures using a statistical computing package.
* Develop the ability to fit probability models to data by both estimating and testing hypotheses about model parameters.
